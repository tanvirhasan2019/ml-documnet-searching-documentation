## 🛠️ **Key Components**

### 1. **UI Layer (Frontend)**
- **Technologies:** React.js (or Next.js)
- **Features:**
  - 🔐 **Login/Registration:** User authentication with JWT or OAuth (Google).
  - 📊 **Dashboard:** Display file analytics, charts, and visualizations.
  - 📤 **Upload/Download Files:** Interface for file management.
  - 📈 **Visualization:** Use charts for file analytics via OpenSearch Dashboards or other tools.
  - 🔍 **Search:** Search indexed files by metadata or embeddings.

### 2. **Node.js API (Backend 1)**
- **Technologies:** Node.js (Express.js), MongoDB
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 👤 **User Authentication:** Handle login, registration, and JWT generation.
  - 🗂️ **File Metadata Storage:** Store and manage metadata (e.g., file name, type, size, permissions) in MongoDB.
  - 🗃️ **File Handling API:** Handle file uploads/downloads using cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage).
  - 🔄 **Search Requests:** Pass search requests (metadata or embedding-based) to OpenSearch.

### 3. **Flask API (Backend 2)**
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Transformers, Keras, Numpy
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 📁 **Feature Extraction:** Extract embeddings from uploaded files using AI models.
  - 🤖 **Machine Learning Tasks:** Process data for embedding generation, anomaly detection, and AI-driven recommendations.
  - 🔗 **Communication:** Interface with Node.js API for tasks requiring machine learning.

### 4. **Storage Layer**
- **Technologies:** Cloud-based storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 💾 **File Storage:** Securely store all uploaded files.
  - 📦 **Versioning & Backup:** Ensure version control and data integrity.
  - 🔑 **Access Control:** Manage access via signed URLs based on user permissions.

### 5. **OpenSearch (Search and Indexing)**
- **Technologies:** OpenSearch
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 🔍 **Indexing:** Index files for fast retrieval using metadata and embeddings.
  - 🧠 **Embedding Search:** Perform vector-based searches for similar content.
  - 📊 **Analytics:** Perform aggregations and custom queries for data insights.
  - 🖥️ **Visualization:** Use OpenSearch Dashboards for real-time data visualizations.

### 6. **OpenSearch Dashboards (Visualization and AI Assistance)**
- **Technologies:** OpenSearch Dashboards (Kibana), Machine Learning Modules
- **Responsibilities:**
  - 📊 **Visualization:** Provide real-time visualizations of queries, file statistics, and analytics.
  - 🔍 **Anomaly Detection:** Detect unusual patterns in file usage or content.
  - 🤖 **Recommendation Engine:** Use AI-driven models to suggest relevant content to users.
  - 💬 **Chat Assistant:** Integrate a chat-based interface for answering queries or interacting with data.

## ⚙️ **System Workflow**

1. **User Interaction (UI Layer)**
   - Users register or log in via the **UI Layer**.
   - The dashboard provides file analytics, visualizations, and search functionalities.
   
2. **File Upload and Processing**
   - The **Node.js API** handles file metadata storage and actual file storage in **Cloud Storage**.
   - The **Flask API** generates embeddings by processing the file content.
   
3. **Indexing in OpenSearch**
   - The **Flask API** sends embeddings to the **Node.js API**, which forwards them to **OpenSearch** for indexing.
   
4. **Search and Visualization**
   - Users can search files by metadata or embeddings.
   - **OpenSearch Dashboards** visualizes search results and file analytics.
   
5. **Anomaly Detection and Recommendations**
   - Based on file patterns, the system suggests files or detects anomalies using AI.

## 📚 **Technology Stack**

### 1. **Frontend (UI Layer)**
- React.js or Next.js for the user interface.
- JWT/OAuth for authentication.
- Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations.

### 2. **Backend 1 (Node.js API)**
- Node.js (Express.js) for file metadata handling, uploads/downloads, authentication, and search queries.
- MongoDB for metadata storage.
- AWS S3 or GCP for file storage.

### 3. **Backend 2 (Flask API)**
- Flask for machine learning tasks.
- TensorFlow, Transformers, Keras for embeddings, anomaly detection, and recommendations.

### 4. **Search and Analytics**
- OpenSearch for indexing and search.
- OpenSearch Dashboards (Kibana) for visualizations and real-time analytics.

### 5. **File Storage**
- AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for secure file storage with signed URLs.
